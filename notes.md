## Notes

There are not many places on earth in which simply writing "city, country" is viewed as a political statement. Jerusalem is one of those places. 

I moved to Jerusalem about 10 years ago from Ireland, where I was born. I am a Jewish immigrant and moved here out of a sense of belonging. 

While I intended to make Israel my home since I was a teenager, I never intended, to live in Jerusalem. As a "tecchie" (I was even then), Tel Aviv seems a much more fitting place to call home. 

However, life is a funny thing. 

I went to ulpan (language school) in Jerusalem due to no other reason than calendar availability. I met a great woman here who loves the city (more than I do!) and married her. I made friends. And over the course of time, I formed the philosophy that Israel is such a small country that to think in binary terms - it's Jerusalem or it's Tel Aviv - is ridiculous. 

Tech and religion can thrive in either. The better view, I believe, is to look at the big picture: we're symbiotic. And collectively, a tiny part of a much bigger whole. 

Jerusalem is a city that is united on paper but divided in reality. An invisible line delineates between the east and the west. On the east, the city self-identifies, to an overwhelming extent, as Palestinian.  There are also additional minority groups (like Armenians); stark divisions within the city's Jewish majority (along mostly religious fault lines); and ethno-linguistic divisions, even, among Jewish immigrants: there are large groups of immigrants from places like Russia, France, and the US, but also smaller groups. 

I believe that Jerusalem should be prosperous, developed, and offer a plentitude of jobs. Relatively little known in international discourse around the city is the fact that Jerusalem has a sizeable poverty problem. 

City planners have also long grappled with the fact that Jerusalem has traditionally suffered from "brain drain" to Tel Aviv: with so much more economic opportunity in Tel Aviv, and generally better salaries to match, why stick it out in a city that's best known - even in Israel - for being the epicenter of religious conflict? 

From the investor viewpoint, this has also had a chilling effect. Endorsing Jerusalem, whether by investment or situating resources there, is a stronger geopolitical statement than doing so in Tel Aviv.

For the above reason - *because* Jerusalem is inherently a political space - I thought I would add a few thoughts, whether for this small resource link or elsewhere:

- This is not censored: any tech resource that exists within the bounds of the city of Jerusalem is in scope. For the city limits, the most obvious source is the Jerusalem Municipality although many East Jerusalemites repudiate their legitimacy. However, Palestinian approxiations of the delineation of 'Al Quds' for this purpose are similar. 
- I originally wanted to create a list of companies in Jerusalem but then (although it sounds a bit jargony) decided on "ecosystem." Because any tech scene is truly much more than sum of the companies within that geography.
