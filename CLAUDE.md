I created this repository to gather together some tech resources in Jerusalem. It is open source/public.

Motivations:

As is well known, there is far less 'tech' in Jerusalem (where I live) versus elsewhere in Israel. I am passionate about technology and the city's future - and think it's important that what *is* here is curated and documented. 

Sometimes, curation, in this regard, comes to mean "persuasion." I do not believe in that. The intention is not to say "look! There IS tech in Jerusalem!". But rather to say: here's what's here. 

I chose the term "ecosystem" because, while a little jargony, it's sufficiently broad to capture the diversity of factors that go into making a tech scene in a locality what it is. I think it's important to capture as many facets of that as possible:

- companies 
- people 
- VCs / capital sources 
- workspaces 
- events groups  / meetups, events 
- organisations (incl governmental) 

Jerusalem is a complicated city. I've authored `notes.md` to put my cards on the table: this is who I am; this is not a politically motivated (or curated) list - projects are "in scope" so long as they exist, geographically, within Jerusalem.
